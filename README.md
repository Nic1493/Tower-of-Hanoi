# Tower of Hanoi


This is part of my game clone series, where I take a game and recreate it in Unity, challenging myself to write all the code and create all the graphical assets (except fonts) from scratch.

This is a clone of an ancient puzzle game, [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).

While I could get away with using Unity's cylinder primitive as the discs (because nobody would know that the rods would skewer through the discs), I decided to model the discs in Blender anyways, and hollow out the centre of each cylinder. So, each disc is a part of a .blend file, and isn't automatically generated and resized upon the start of the game.
